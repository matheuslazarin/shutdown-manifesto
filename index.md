## The Shutdown Manifesto

We are a group of people building and working for Software Companies.
Over time, we learned to respect:

**Profitability** over monetization  
**Customers** over users  
**Stability** over scalability  
**Clients** over investors  
**People** over power

While we understand the importance of every item on the right, we work for the items on the left.
